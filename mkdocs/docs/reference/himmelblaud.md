## SYNOPSIS

```text
himmelblaud [OPTIONS]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `himmelblaud` daemon is responsible for authenticating users
against Azure Entra ID and managing group and user information. It
operates as a background service, handling authentication requests and
maintaining a cache of user and group data.

## OPTIONS

**-r**, **--skip-root-check**

option is risky and should never be used in production environments due
to potential security vulnerabilities. It can also be set through the
environment variable **HIMMELBLAU_SKIP_ROOT_CHECK**.


**-d**, **--debug**  
Enable verbose debug output. This option will show detailed diagnostic
information useful for troubleshooting and debugging. Can also be set
via the environment variable **HIMMELBLAU_DEBUG**.


**-t**, **--configtest**  
Display the daemon’s current configuration and exit. This is useful for
verifying that the configuration file is correctly formatted and
contains valid options.


**-c**, **--config** <config>  
Specify the path to the configuration file for the daemon. The default
configuration file is located at */etc/himmelblau/himmelblaud.conf*.
This option can also be set via the environment variable
**HIMMELBLAU_CONFIG**.


**-h**, **--help**  
Show the help message with information about available options.


**-V**, **--version**  
Print the version of the `himmelblaud` daemon and exit.
