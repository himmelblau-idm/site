# About

## How Himmelblau Came to Be

In late 2022 and early 2023, several Linux vendors met with Microsoft to explore Entra ID integration for Linux. Microsoft's proposal centered on a proprietary "broker" the community would be expected to integrate with. The debates around that direction - and concerns about quality, security, and openness - left a clear gap for a community-driven alternative. Himmelblau started in 2023 to fill that vacuum with a transparent, community-driven implementation that prioritizes security and quality.

Early on, Himmelblau reused client components from **Kanidm** (a Rust identity platform), then evolved quickly to address Entra ID and Intune specifics; the two projects continue to share a number of dependencies.

Samba's role has been integral from day one. With continuous discussions happening within the Samba Team, Himmelblau offers a path that some engineers view as the future direction for Samba - keeping the project relevant as the ecosystem evolves.

> **Name.** "Himmelblau" is German for "sky-blue/Azure," a playful nod to Microsoft's cloud while signaling that our implementation is open.

## The Team Behind Himmelblau

Key engineers include **David Mulder**, **Samuel Cabrero** and **William Brown**, backed by a team of community contributors.

## Supported Platforms

Himmelblau supports multiple enterprise and community Linux distributions such as SUSE, Rocky (RHEL), Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian.

## Vision

Himmelblau exists to make Linux work cleanly with Entra ID and Intune - open, auditable, and production-ready - so admins get Windows-grade login, MFA, and device management without vendor lock-in.
