            <h2>Origins and Mission</h2>
            <p>Himmelblau was conceived to address the growing need for seamless integration between Linux environments and Microsoft’s Azure Entra ID. Himmelblau bridges compatibility barriers, delivering robust Azure Entra ID authentication for Linux systems.</p>
            <p>Originating as a fork of the <strong>Kanidm OAuth2 client</strong> led by <strong>William Brown</strong>, a SUSE engineer, Himmelblau tailors the Kanidm framework for Azure Entra ID, leveraging its proven reliability for cloud and hybrid authentication.</p>
        </section>
<section id="key-features">
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>Himmelblau includes several distinct features designed to support robust and seamless integration with Azure Entra ID for Linux environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Azure Entra ID Integration:</strong> Native support for Azure Entra ID, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), secure token management, and compliance with modern enterprise identity standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Kerberos Compatibility:</strong> Extends Azure Entra ID functionality to include Kerberos authentication, supporting both cloud and on-premises use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source and Modular:</strong> Built on the open-source principles established by Kanidm, Himmelblau continues the tradition of transparency, flexibility, and community-driven innovation.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Roadmap:</strong> Future development plans include adding passwordless MFA, improving Kerberos caching, and integrating with Gnome Online Accounts to enhance user experience and security.</li>
