# About

## Origins and Mission

Himmelblau was conceived to address the growing need for seamless integration between Linux environments and Microsoft’s Azure Entra ID. Himmelblau bridges compatibility barriers, delivering robust Azure Entra ID authentication for Linux systems.

Originating as a fork of the **Kanidm OAuth2 client** led by **William Brown**, a SUSE engineer, Himmelblau tailors the Kanidm framework for Azure Entra ID, leveraging its proven reliability for cloud and hybrid authentication.

## Key Features

Himmelblau includes several distinct features designed to support robust and seamless integration with Azure Entra ID for Linux environments:

- **Azure Entra ID Integration:** Native support for Azure Entra ID, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), secure token management, and compliance with modern enterprise identity standards.
- **Kerberos Compatibility:** Extends Azure Entra ID functionality to include Kerberos authentication, supporting both cloud and on-premises use cases.
- **Open Source and Modular:** Built on the open-source principles established by Kanidm, Himmelblau continues the tradition of transparency, flexibility, and community-driven innovation.
- **Advanced Roadmap:** Future development plans include adding passwordless MFA, improving Kerberos caching, and integrating with Gnome Online Accounts to enhance user experience and security.

## Kanidm’s Legacy

Led by **William Brown**, Kanidm provided secure, open-source identity services for Linux environments, forming the foundation on which Himmelblau builds.

## The Team Behind Himmelblau

Key contributors include **David Mulder** and **William Brown**, backed by a team of SUSE engineers and open-source contributors.

## Supported Platforms

Himmelblau supports multiple enterprise and community Linux distributions such as SUSE, Rocky (RHEL), Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian.

## Vision

Himmelblau envisions seamless integration of Linux systems with modern identity platforms, ensuring parity with Windows environments in terms of authentication security and ease.
