## Tray Icons for `o365` on GNOME Shell

The Himmelblau **`o365` package** integrates Microsoft Office desktop applications (Teams, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) with Linux. These applications rely on **tray icons** for managing their background processes and quick-access menus.

### GNOME Shell and Tray Icons

GNOME Shell does not display tray icons by default. If you are using GNOME, the Office apps provided by `o365` will not expose their controls unless tray icon support is enabled.

### Enabling Tray Icons

To enable tray icon support in GNOME Shell:

1. Visit the official GNOME Extensions website:
   ðŸ‘‰ [AppIndicator Support Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

2. Toggle the switch to **ON** to install and enable *AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support*.

Once enabled, the tray icons for all `o365` apps will appear in the top panel next to your system indicators.

âœ… This step is **only required if you use the `o365` package**.
